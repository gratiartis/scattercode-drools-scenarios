scattercode-drools-scenarios
============================

A bundle of test scenarios, used to help me experiment with Drools.

It's a Maven-based project (http://maven.apache.org/), so assuming that you 
have Maven installed, you should be able to get your command prompt to the 
project base directory and run:
 
```bash
  mvn clean test
```

... which should run all the tests for you.
